Leave Calculator
The Leave Calculator is a web application designed to help users find the best periods for taking leave based on a custom calendar dataset. It allows users to select a date range and maximum leave days to calculate and display the most optimal periods for taking time off.

Features
Date Range Selection: Users can select a start and end date using an interactive calendar interface.
Max Leave Days: Users can specify the maximum number of leave days they wish to take within the selected date range.
Calculation: Upon clicking the "Calculate Best Leave Periods" button, the application communicates with a server to analyze the custom calendar data and determine the best periods for leave.
Results Display: The application displays the top 10 best leave periods based on total days off and leave days needed.
Refreshing: Users can reset the date range and results with a single click using the refresh button.
Technologies Used
Frontend: React.js, Axios for API communication, React Calendar for date selection.
Backend: Node.js with Express, CORS for cross-origin resource sharing, JSON file storage for custom calendar data.
Styling: Custom CSS and Tailwind CSS for responsive design and UI components.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
